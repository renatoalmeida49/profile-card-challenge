## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The position of a custom background can be very tricky. I've learn a lot about that.

### Continued development

I would like to, again, use SASS and SCSS. I need to learn how to do that without use VUEJS or other framework.  
  
The HTML Semantic could be better.

### Useful resources

- [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_background-position.asp) - This helped me for remind me how to use the property. And I have learned a news things about this property.
